This code is written to identify a Kalman filter using an artificial neural network (ANN), specifically a multilayer perceptron (MLP) responsible for processing MPU9250 sensor data. It's worth mentioning that all the components of the MLP, including forward and backward processes, have been manually implemented in this code without utilizing any pre-built functions, solely relying on fundamental commands of the C programming language. Although the entire training process of the ANN is implemented in this code, the initial random weights of the MLP have not been selected. This is because the weights used are those of the MLP that have been previously trained in the MATLAB simulator for this purpose. In other words, this code represents the second stage of NN training, where unlike the first stage that used random data, real IMU sensor data has been employed.

The general architecture of this MLP is as follows:
Number of inputs: 6 neurons (including accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data).\\
Hidden layer: 6 neurons with hyperbolic tangent function (Tanh) activation.
Output layer: 2 neurons with linear function activation.
The backpropagation (BP) algorithm has been utilized to train this NN. 
Its optimization function is gradient descent (GD), and its cost function is mean squared error (MSE).

Although this code is written in the C language, due to the requirements of Arduino's framework, some C++ functions are used within it. However, prominent features of C++, such as object orientation, are absent.
